- Some function names have been changed to work with Nautilus.
  - `htonl` is now `lwip_htonl`
  - `getpeername` is now `lwip_getpeername`
  - `inet_ntoa` is now `ip4addr_ntoa`
  - `close` is now `lwip_close`
  - `setsockopt` is now `lwip_setsockopt`
  - `select` is now `lwip_select`
  - `recvfrom` is now `lwip_recvfrom`
  - `connect` is now `lwip_connect`
  - `accept` is now `lwip_accept`
  - `recv` is now `lwip_recv`
  - `htons` is now `lwip_htons`
  - `socket` is now `lwip_socket`
  - `inet_addr` is now `ipaddr_addr`
  - `gethostbyname` is now `lwip_gethostbyname`
  - `bind` is now `lwip_bind`
  - `listen` is now `lwip_listen`
  - `fcntl` is now `lwip_fcntl`
  - `getsockopt` is now `lwip_getsockopt`
- No messages will be printed to `stderr`.
- The call to `gethostname` is removed and the hostname is "host" now.
- `rfbScreenInfoPtr::deferUpdateTime` must be 0, since `gettimeofday` function calls will not work and non-zero values will require that.
- Removed calls to `sscanf`, which is referrencing `__isoc99_sscanf`. Hopefully it doesn't matter too much for now.
- Removed call to `rfbProcessFileTransfer` in the `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage` function.
- `sraSpanListPrint` now does nothing.
- The calls to `rfbSendFileTransferChunk` are now removed.
- Removed chunk with call to `getrlimit`.
- `rfbEncryptAndStorePasswd` and `rfbRandomBytes` now does nothing. This shouldn't matter too much since we're not really using auth.
- `rfbUsage` now does nothing. Hopefully this shouldn't matter too much since we're not using the CLI.
